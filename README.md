## MEETS SPECIFICATIONS

 - [X] The application was created with create-react-app and requires only npm install and npm start to get it installed and launched
 - [X] An updated README that describes the project and has instructions for installing and launching the project is included.
 - [X] The main page shows 3 shelves for books. Each book is shown on the correct shelf, along with its title and all of its authors.
 - [X] The main page shows a control that allows users to move books between shelves. The control should be tied to each book instance. The functionality of moving a book to a different shelf works correctly.
 - [X] When the browser is refreshed, the same information is displayed on the page.
 - [X] The search page has a search input field.
 - [X] The search page behaves correctly: 
 1. As the user types into the search field, books that match the query are displayed on the page, along with their titles and authors. You can use throttle/debounce but are not required to do so.
 2. Search results are not shown when all of the text is deleted out of the search input box.
 3. Invalid queries are handled and prior search results are not shown.
 4. The search works correctly when a book does not have a thumbnail or an author. (To test this, try searching for "poetry" and "biography"). (It's fine to filter out books with missing thumbnails.)
 5. The user is able to search for multiple words, such as “artificial intelligence.”
 - [X] Search results on the search page allow the user to select “currently reading”, “want to read”, or “read” to place the book in a certain shelf.
 - [X] When an item is categorized on the search page and the user navigates to the main page, it appears on that shelf in the main page.
 - [x] Routing
 - [x] Component state is passed down from parent components to child components. The state variable is not modified directly - setState() function is used correctly.
